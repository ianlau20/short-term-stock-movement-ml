        "# Predicting Short-Term Stock Price Movements Using Machine Learning (Milestone 1)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Category: Application / Empirical Study\n",
        "- Team Members: Jiho Hahn (jh2982), Ian Lau (icl8)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Stock markets are influenced by many interacting factors, from macroeconomic conditions to company-specific events, and short-term price movements are often considered unpredictable. Still, past research and industry practice suggest that certain technical indicators and statistical patterns can provide useful predictive signals. Our project aims to model daily stock returns as a binary classification problem (up vs. down) using machine learning techniques introduced in this course.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This problem is motivating because it is both practical and methodologically challenging, since financial data is noisy, non-stationary, and prone to overfitting. By tackling it, we can assess how well machine learning methods generalize to a real-world high-variance setting. Additionally, if one were able to consistently accurately predict stock markets, they would be able to profit by investing.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This project will be detailed benchmarking / analysis of multiple machine learning models on an existing financial dataset. We are focused on evaluating their predictive performance and robustness in short-term stock movement prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Method & Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Model and output\n",
        "\n",
        "As a baseline, Linear Regression model is trained to predict whether a stock price will go up or down in the following day, based on the metrics from the past.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "Features and labels are extracted from the [US Stock Market Data & Technical Indicators dataset(USSMD) in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilkohli/us-stock-market-data-60-extracted-features/data). It provides plenty of attributes(64) which our model can train on.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Feature & label extraction\n",
        "\n",
        "We chose 12 engineering features from our dataset of 64 raw attributes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Close(t) – Captures the most representative daily price level, forming the basis for trends and returns.\n",
        "2. Volume – Reflects trading activity and investor interest, often preceding large price movements.\n",
        "3. MA10 – Short-term moving average that captures recent trend direction and short momentum shifts.\n",
        "4. MA20 – Medium-term moving average that smooths noise and identifies broader trend alignment or crossovers.\n",
        "5. RSI – Measures momentum and overbought/oversold conditions, signaling potential reversals.\n",
        "6. MACD – Highlights changes in momentum by comparing short- and long-term EMAs, useful for trend shifts.\n",
        "7. MACD_EMA – The smoothed version of MACD that indicates confirmed or weakening momentum signals.\n",
        "8. Volatility_10d – Quantifies recent price variability, revealing risk regimes and market uncertainty.\n",
        "9. Return_1d – Captures immediate momentum or mean-reversion tendencies from the prior day’s move.\n",
        "10. Index_SP500_Return_1d – Represents overall market sentiment, accounting for macro-level correlations.\n",
        "11. High_Low_Range – Measures intraday volatility, hinting at potential breakout or reversal conditions.\n",
        "12. Return_5d – Encodes short-term momentum or drift over the past week, complementing single-day returns.\n",
        "Then, we will apply a range of machine learning models covered throughout the semester, starting with baseline linear regression in this milestone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Label is whether the following day's 1-day return is potivie or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. Train & Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "- Train & test is carried out per ticker. (e.g. AAPL, MSFT, ...) Each ticker has its own dynamics and by training per ticker, and some stocks (e.g. AAPL) have stronger momentum or trend reversals than others (e.g. utilities). Logistic regression per ticker can tune weights to that stock’s specific technical indicator responses.\n",
        "- Rows are split into training & test dataset in 80-20 ratio with respect to the date window per ticker. The ratio is a simple, standard rule of thumb.\n",
        "- COVID sell-off started around Feb 19th 2020, so we ruled out the rows that date during Covid outbreak to avoid extreme market volatility that could distort model training and hinder evaluation under typical market conditions.\n",
        "- Evaluation is analyzed with prediction accuracies.\n",

A random coin flip would yield 50% accuracy. This is a common initial outcome in stock market prediction, indicating that the features currently used (likely standard technical indicators) do not contain a clear, linear signal strong enough for reliable classification by the current model.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Systematic Errors (MSFT): The result for MSFT (46.0%) is statistically worse than a random guess. This suggests that the model is not only failing to find a pattern but is systematically overfitting to noise in a way that causes it to be wrong more often than not. This highlights the need for better regularization or a more complex model.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Marginal Outperformance (AMZN, GOOGL): The model shows its best performance on AMZN (54.5%) and GOOGL (55.0%). This suggests that the current feature set may capture some slight predictive signal specific to these high-growth/tech stocks, which often have higher momentum or clearer price trends than older industrials (like GE, IBM)."
